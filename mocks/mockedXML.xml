<p><em><b>Warning: Spoilers ahead for </b></em><b>Scream 5</b></p>
<p>Characters in the <a href="https://time.com/4972141/best-halloween-movies-to-watch/" >1996 <i>Scream</i></a> were well-versed in the ground rules for horror movies. As Woodsboro, Calif.&rsquo;s resident movie geek <span style="font-weight: 400;">Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) made clear in the franchise&rsquo;s first installment, </span>abstaining <span style="font-weight: 400;">from sex is your best chance of making it out of a scary movie alive. He also advised you never, ever say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back&rdquo;&mdash;because you definitely won&rsquo;t be.</span></p>
<p>More than 25 years later, a new <i>Scream</i> offers some new rules. Early in the film, out Jan. 14, former sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette) lays out updated guidelines on how to survive a horror movie. Dewey&rsquo;s new rules aren&rsquo;t as conservative as those shared by Randy&mdash;purity rings are so &lsquo;90s, after all&mdash;but they&rsquo;re still pretty meta. <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can&rsquo;t survive nine stabbings across four films without noticing a few patterns. Unfortunately, the new </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s final girl, Sam Carpenter (</span><a href="https://time.com/6072400/in-the-heights-review/" ><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In The Heights</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo; Melissa Barrera), doesn&rsquo;t realize how prophetic Dewey&rsquo;s directives are until the film&rsquo;s final act.</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dewey&rsquo;s golden rule is a direct callback to the original </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Never trust the love interest. In the 1996 movie, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) learned this the hard way when her boyfriend and horror fanatic Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) revealed his hometown killing spree was an act of revenge against her mom, Maureen, whose affair with his dad led to his parents&rsquo; separation. Maureen was his first victim and he wanted Sidney to be his last so that he could pin the murders on her.</span></p>

<figcaption class="image-caption" ><span class="credit" >Paramount Pictures</span><span class="caption" >Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox in <i>Scream</i></span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dewey&rsquo;s new rules are an early clue that this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has much more in common with its source material beyond its title. At their core, the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movies aren&rsquo;t teen slasher films, but are bloodsoaked whodunnits in which anyone and everyone is a possible suspect. Figuring out who&rsquo;s behind the Ghostface mask is part of the fun&mdash;and often the killer is the most obvious choice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the original: Billy&rsquo;s red flags could be misinterpreted as red herrings, which made the final reveal that he&rsquo;s the one doing all the stabbing a satisfying shocker. The fact that his accomplice Stu (Matthew Lillard) doesn&rsquo;t really have a motive beyond &ldquo;peer pressure&rdquo; adds to the finale&rsquo;s shock value. It also lets fans know that a character doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need an elaborate reason to kill to be the killer&mdash;which might seem a little weak to the Gen Z teens of Woodsboro seen in the 2022 film. These highschoolers are more obsessed with </span><a href="https://time.com/5304199/hereditary-toni-collette/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;elevated horror&rdquo;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Witch</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Follows,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Babadook</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the classics like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Halloween</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, they have to respect the slasher films that came before to solve a new mystery. This time around, Ghostface is killing off anyone with a connection to the original Woodsboro murders, which were the inspiration behind the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stab </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">movie franchise, a running gag in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is neither a reboot nor a sequel; it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;requel&rdquo; as Randy&rsquo;s niece Mindy Meeks-Martin (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellowjackets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo; Jasmin Savoy Brown) tells her friends in the early days of the town&rsquo;s latest tragedy&mdash;in front of a literal shrine to Randy nonetheless. The old rules don&rsquo;t necessarily apply, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s filmmakers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aren&rsquo;t reinventing the wheel either. A &ldquo;requel&rdquo; toes the line between the past and present, offering a new-ish take on a classic while still paying respect to the legacy of the franchise. With the 2022 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that means connecting the present and the past by introducing a surprising family link: Sam is Billy&rsquo;s daughter.</span></p>
<h2><b>How the new </b><b><i>Scream</i></b><b> fits into the franchise </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trick of making the killer a relative of someone from the original murders has been used in the three previous sequels to varying degrees of success. In 1997&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Billy Loomis&rsquo; mom (a deliciously deranged Laurie Metcalf) follows Sidney to college to seek vengeance. It&rsquo;s basically impossible to guess that she&rsquo;s the one behind it all, an ending that delighted some viewers while aggravating others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three years later, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream 3</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduced Roman (Scott Foley) as not only the murderer, but Sid&rsquo;s secret half-brother, Maureen&rsquo;s illegitimate son, who was the architect of this whole tragic saga. The director of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stab 3</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s movie franchise within a movie franchise, reveals that he showed Billy video proof of his dad&rsquo;s affair which encouraged him to kill. It&rsquo;s a long retcon that doesn&rsquo;t quite feel in step with the original&rsquo;s ending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, when </span><a href="https://entertainment.time.com/2011/04/15/scream-4-movie-review/" ><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream 4</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">turns Sidney&rsquo;s teenage cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) into a fame-seeking psychopath out to become the sole survivor of the copycat murders that turned her cuz into a legend, it feels like a satisfying turn of events. Over a decade later, a narcissistic murderer willing to kill her own family for the Instagram &ldquo;likes&rdquo; feels ahead of its time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Billy, Jill&rsquo;s accomplice is her movie-obsessed friend Charlie (Rory Culkin) who wanted to remake the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stab </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">movies, but ends up becoming just another casualty. It&rsquo;s always important to remember that movie obsessives don&rsquo;t usually fare well in this franchise&mdash;especially when they&rsquo;re trying to rewrite the series to satisfy the fans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resists the urge to make Sam the killer, a choice that would be a cutesy callback to the original in a less confident franchise. Sam doesn&rsquo;t want to take down Sidney, the woman who killed her dear ol&rsquo; dad. Instead, she is afraid she&rsquo;ll turn out just like Billy, whose ghost appears to her as an angel and devil on her shoulders. Sam is just a pawn in this cat and mouse game to get Sidney, who has vowed to never step foot in Woodsboro, back to the town. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get her back, this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ups the stakes, brutally killing off Dewey just before he gets to play the hero&mdash;and win back his estranged wife, Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Sidney returns as the wise sage who is now living that LuluLemon mom life with her husband Mark, whose name real </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fans will recognize as Patrick Dempsey&rsquo;s character in</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Scream 3</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sidney&rsquo;s back to pass along some final girl knowledge, seek vengeance for her fallen friend, and maybe pass the torch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final set piece takes place in a familiar locale, Stu&rsquo;s house, where another party is being thrown despite a murderer being on the loose. Just like the original, the home&rsquo;s latest occupant Amber (Mikey Madison), the bestie of Sam&rsquo;s little sister Tara (Jenna Ortega), is one of two killers. Like any true crime fan, Amber did her homework on the house&rsquo;s history and befriended a fellow </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stab </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stan on Reddit who just so happens to be Sam&rsquo;s boyfriend Richie (Jack Quaid). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike previous </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> films, Richie isn&rsquo;t interested in revenge or becoming a star, he&rsquo;s just a fanboy with a bone to pick. Specifically, he thinks </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stab 8</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> jumped the shark and he wants to remake the film. It&rsquo;s a motive that feels a little to prescient knowing the toxic fervor of </span><a href="https://time.com/5946917/snyder-cut-justice-league-fans/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">the #SnyderCut campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Last Jedi </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">discourse. Richie doesn&rsquo;t see himself as a serial killer but a budding screenwriter just trying to do right by the movie and its fans since obviously he knows best. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The joke&rsquo;s on him though since his rewrite is as schlocky as anything Hollywood could come up with. In his version of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stab 8</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sam is not the hero of the story, but the villain. Having Billy Loomis&rsquo; daughter show up at the scene of the original crime to kill Sidney 25 years to the day after she killed Billy is akin to resurrecting Palpatine for </span><a href="https://time.com/5752494/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-ending/" ><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s not shocking or inventive, it&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://time.com/5751752/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-the-last-jedi/" ><span style="font-weight: 400;">just lazy fan service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing about rehashing tired storylines is that someone is bound to catch on, which Sam does. (Richie blaming her sister for the murders seemed to be the real giveaway.) Sam is able to suss out that Richie isn&rsquo;t the nice guy he claims to be, but a toxic fanboy. She channels some of her late dad&rsquo;s energy to murder her love interest who we should have known couldn&rsquo;t be trusted. After all, Dewey predicted this outcome the moment he met him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Amber, she puts a new spin on Stu&rsquo;s &ldquo;the movies made me do it&rdquo; defense by claiming she&rsquo;s been radicalized by 4Chan. But the &ldquo;message boards made me do it&rdquo; is a weak excuse that not even she can commit to. Amber is burned alive by Gale, a bit of karma for killing her late love, but like every other killer in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movies she returns hellbent on finishing her plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a scorched Amber makes one final attempt to kill Sidney and Sam, it&rsquo;s Tara who gets to save the day while getting in the final word. &ldquo;I still prefer </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Babadook</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&rdquo; she says as she pulls the trigger. Moviegoers might feel the same way, but the new </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scream</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> manages to find new life in a dying genre. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time Henry Downes took command of the Black Joke, the ship had only been on the waters under that name for just a year. A former slave ship itself, the Black Joke was captured in 1827 by the <a href="https://www.nmrn.org.uk/news-events/nmrn-blog/key-role-african-seamen-royal-navy%E2%80%99s-anti-slavery-campaign"  target="_blank">British Royal Navy&rsquo;s West Africa Squadron</a>, its incredible speed repurposed for chasing down and capturing slave traders as they attempted to make their way to the Americas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For five months, Downes, had been on watch for just one ship&mdash;the notorious slaver </span><a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/P_1940-1214-54"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reputed to be back off the coast of Western Africa and known to have already illegally transported thousands of the enslaved to the Americas in its sordid career. In mid-January 1829, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while patrolling near Lagos, came across what appeared to be several Brazilian slavers embarking Africans. Standing o&#64256; the coast so as not to spook them, rumor reached Downes that one ship was a fancy, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">familiar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spanish brig nearly ready to set sail&mdash;after the waiting and unproductive cruising, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had, all unexpected, made its appearance.</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the water, rumors traveled both ways; just as Downes had heard that this was the brig he sought, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had, in turn, been warned of the appearance of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Damaso Forgannes, the recently promoted captain of El Almirante, could not have been less concerned about the prospect of capture. Reputed to have laughed upon hearing the news, Forgannes scoffed publicly at the ludicrous notion of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">capturing his vessel, continuing to openly purchase enslaved people. The reaction wasn&rsquo;t entirely unreasonable&mdash;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was an inordinately expensive ship, even for a slaver, purpose-built and equipped with every advance in design its (undoubtedly American) shipwrights could conceive. If making a break for open water was not an option, the slaver crewed upward of 80 men and carried 14 powerful guns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no question that the two-gunned </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a crew of 47 plus a temporary supplement of eight men from another Squadron ship, was hugely outpowered in just about every measure. Downes, as undeterred as his opposite number on the slaver, set the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just out of sight of the harbor, periodically sending boats to check on the progress of the Spanish brig and make sure it continued to load human cargo, since the presence of the enslaved would be the vital evidence against </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that might ultimately condemn it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing to gather information soon proved worthwhile, especially when a crew member reported back to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the slaver&rsquo;s destination. Having thus discovered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s next port, Downes spent every idle hour calculating the best way to get to the Antilles, moving to a position that hopefully anticipated the correct course. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was as prepared as it could be. Now, truly, all they could do was wait. Then, on Jan. 31, a fancy Spanish brig appeared with first light. Primed as the crew aboard the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">must have been, they immediately crowded on all sail and, catching a scant breeze, gave chase . . . but the delays weren&rsquo;t over. In the vital moment, after five months of searching and two weeks of waiting, the wind died. Becalmed, yet undeterred, the crew set to rowing. Nine hours and 30 grueling miles later, they caught the slaver at sunset, who met the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s arrival by immediately &#64257;ring on it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://time.com/6094376/transatlantic-slave-trade-disease-outbreaks-epidemiology/" ><em>How the Origins of Epidemiology Are Linked to the Transatlantic Slave Trade</em></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything about catching the Spanish brig had been difficult, and Forgannes had no intention of bucking that trend. Throughout the night, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">repeatedly attempted to close on its would-be captor, &#64257;ring broadside after broadside. The tender&rsquo;s bulwarks were not equipped to protect its crew from the slave trader&rsquo;s heavy armament, so still mostly becalmed, Downes ordered the exhausted crew back to oars. For the rest of the night, far from taking the break they&rsquo;d richly earned, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> evaded the slaver by means of paddling rather than tacking sails, always just out of reach of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s guns. The move was clever, effective and utterly exhausting. By dawn on Feb. 1, both ships were much as they had been the evening before, still becalmed less than a mile and a half from each other, and with the arrival of the sun, the fighting temporarily ceased. Clearly everyone was prepared for the coming battle, but for the duration of the hot, still morning, both crews could do little else but rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just past noon, the breeze returned. Rather than run, Forgannes moved toward the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, still certain of victory. Downes, altering his position, wasn&rsquo;t intimidated. As soon as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was within range of grapeshot to the aft of the slaver, Forgannes tried for another broadside. Mortal peril notwithstanding, the crew of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had been waiting for this moment for months, and they responded with three cheers and two double-shotted cannons aimed directly at the slave trader&rsquo;s deck. For 45 minutes the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">held, but when it came to guns, nothing had changed&mdash;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had too many of them. Rather than continue when they were so clearly outmatched, and with the slaver again closing in, Downes switched tactics entirely and gave the order to bring the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alongside and prepare to board. But suddenly, in what must have been an annoyingly familiar turn of events, the wind died. Again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This shift in conditions allowed Forgannes to get o&#64256; a shot that could well have been deadly for everyone aboard the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had it been better aimed. A light wind 15 minutes later allowed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, buoyed by the near miss and even more con&#64257;dent in success, to once again take the offensive and move in for another attack. The breeze wasn&rsquo;t much, but it was enough to give the more maneuverable ship the advantage, and Downes knew exactly which ship that was. In that moment, Downes asked every bit of skill from his crew and everything of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;and both delivered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully attained </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s leeward quarter, and from there it gave the slaver all it could handle and then some. For 20 minutes, without pause or respite, the tender raked the quarter and stern of the slaver, and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">did not miss&mdash;seeing the damage subsequently, the Squadron&rsquo;s Commodore declared that he had &ldquo;never in his life witnessed a more beautiful specimen of good gunnery.&rdquo; The repeated attack to just one section of the slave trader created a serious risk of structural damage that, if continued, might well have rendered the ship permanently unseaworthy. Realizing this, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at last struck its colors and surrendered.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://time.com/newsletter-history" ><em>Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter</em></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s crew finally boarded, they discovered that, regrettably, 11 enslaved people had been killed in the prolonged action. Among the slaver&rsquo;s crew, 15 were killed, including Forgannes, and every officer but the third mate and 13 wounded. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had fared better, but had six wounded, two of whom would eventually succumb to their injuries. Both ships&rsquo; rigging had taken extensive damage, though </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had the worst of it. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had at least one Black, non-Kru seaman, a free African named Joseph Francis, who&rsquo;d been determined to &ldquo;strike a personal blow&rdquo; against the infamous slaver. During the battle, he&rsquo;d got 12 feet of chain into one of the ship&rsquo;s guns as it was being loaded; when it was &#64257;red, &ldquo;the starboard main shrouds of the slaver were cut o&#64256; [. . .] as if by the single blow of an axe.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with the damage, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was still a valuable prize, but there was more. One of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s officers, upon searching the slaver, discovered a large cache of gold doubloons; the capture ultimately cost the slaver&rsquo;s owners roughly &ldquo;35,000 dollars.&rdquo; Of arguably more importance&mdash;at least to the Squadron&mdash;was the additional discovery of cryptic letters in cipher. Less than a week later, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sybille, the Squadron&rsquo;s flagship, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would capture the slaver </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniao</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which, during the chase, had been seen tossing papers. When </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sybille </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recovered the letters, they, in conjunction with those found on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Almirante</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, divulged the nature and location of secret slave trade routes to Havana, then one of the world&rsquo;s busiest slaving ports. They also warned other slavers that the West Africa Squadron had become an effective force, and only fast, well-armed ships could have a chance of escape. Rumors would continue to spread&mdash;the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was more than just another WAS ship to avoid. It was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ship to avoid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would sail for three more years before being burned in 1832. Once a home to heinous suffering, and despite a tenure complicated by dubious diplomacy, pirates, revolt, pandemic, mysterious disappearances, and disasters both natural and man-made, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had become the scourge of enslavers and the symbol of a squadron, proof that the suppression of the slave trade wasn&rsquo;t an impossible mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not, however, yet another narrative in which Britain mostly saves the day. The history of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and certainly that of the Royal Navy) resists such simplistic assessment. Far from a story of unmitigated White Saviorism, this complex history has few uncomplicated heroes, even when writ as small as a single ship in a much-larger landscape. The slave trade, it&rsquo;s laggardly, stutter-step demise&mdash;the choices made then have filtered into every facet of our modern world, and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Joke</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s cruise is still in the food we eat and clothes we wear, in our borders and economies, in how historical legacies of racialized violence, colonialism and exploitation are perceived and remembered. The repercussions of the <a href="https://time.com/6094376/transatlantic-slave-trade-disease-outbreaks-epidemiology/" >transatlantic slave trade</a> surround us, still, and regardless of which side of the Atlantic we live on, we can feel the reverberations of centuries of industrialized human trafficking and the turbulent decades encompassing the fight to stop it. Escaping the slave trade was difficult; <a href="https://time.com/4274901/slavery-traces-history/" >escaping its legacy</a> has proved impossible.</span></p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6139102/sagarika-sriram-dubai/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sagarika Sriram was just 10 years old when she started reading newspaper stories about a planet in peril&mdash;one about a whale that washed ashore after an oil spill, another about turtles found with plastic in their stomachs. She knew right then that she wanted to do something to take action, and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">joined an environmental group that organized cleanup campaigns in her home city of Dubai. The experience, she says, &#8220;helped me understand what an individual can do and how I can really make a difference.&#8221; But individual power is mightiest at scale, and in 2016</span>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">as a project for a coding class, Sriram created </span><a href="https://www.k4bworld.com/"  target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids for a Better World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital platform that has since brought together nearly 100,000 youths from around the world who want to learn how they, too, can fight climate change.</span><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p class="p2">Sriram, now 16, has been called &ldquo;an inspiration to all young girls in her country and West Asia&rdquo; by the U.N. Environment Programme. She is at the fore of a growing cohort of youth climate activists organizing and mobilizing online in the name of a cleaner, healthier future. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the generation that is going to face the consequences if the climate crisis is not tackled,&rdquo; Sriram says, echoing the sentiment of other young global climate leaders, like Sweden&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2019-greta-thunberg/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greta Thunberg</a>. She recalls taking note of Bali&rsquo;s Melati Wijsen, a teenager who successfully pressured leaders there to ban plastic bags in 2019. &ldquo;Such inspirational and drastic change like that is what taught me to never give up,&rdquo; says Sriram, who works closely with other youth activists and organizations across the Middle East.</p>
<p class="p2">As well as online engagement, Sriram organizes local cleanups on beaches and deserts in the United Arab Emirates, collecting garbage such as cigarette butts and face masks. The pandemic has made it &ldquo;a little more complicated to conduct these events,&rdquo; she says, but we&rsquo;ve suggested that people can go on their own in their own little groups of families and make an impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowing climate change requires drastic action on the part of governments and corporations, but Sriram believes even little individual actions can create a &#8220;ripple effect&#8221; and help build momentum in the right direction. &#8220;Change can be created on large levels even with small actions,&rdquo; she says. Kids for a Better World reflects that thinking, with material designed to teach kids from eight to 16 about climate change and what they can do in their own homes and communities to reverse it (they could grow food or plant trees at home, for instance, or collect recyclables and avoid plastic bags). Sriram wants those lessons to be taught in schools around the world. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Education is the foundation of what we learn and we spend so much time in school, so this is the information which can help change our future,&#8221; she says.</span></p>

<p>Growing up in a desert metropolis that faces risks from rising temperatures and dwindling water supplies made Sriram acutely aware of the need for action. She believes youth advocacy work is effective in bringing needed attention to the challenges the U.A.E. and neighboring countries face. &ldquo;When children spread a message, and you go door-to-door telling people about this, they tend to understand what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she&#8217;s all about small actions, Sriram has big plans herself. She aims to study behavioral economics at Stanford University while continuing her activism work and running Kids for a Better World, with an aim to expand globally and create an &#8220;international team of eco warriors,&#8221; as she puts it. Moreover, she hopes that the work she&#8217;s doing will inspire others to fight for a greener planet, as others inspired her. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re creating our own system of inspirational change makers,&#8221; she says.</span></p>

<p>On the evening of Jan. 3, Connie Schultz, the Pulitzer-winning syndicated columnist and author, was trying to watch <a href="https://time.com/6127997/succession-season-3-finale-what-happens-next/" >HBO&rsquo;s <i>Succession</i></a>, but she kept having to pause it because something reminded her husband of his work. &ldquo;I am watching #Succession with the chairman of the Senate banking committee,&rdquo; Schultz informed her quarter-million Twitter followers, &ldquo;and holy cannoli the ongoing commentary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Schultz nor the husband in question, Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, can recall exactly which episode moved her to compose the <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnieSchultz/status/1478153297198555137"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/ConnieSchultz/status/1478153297198555137&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642252782763000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0G2Y5GAWtNZttD0HNsMJqG" target="_blank">tweet</a>, which has now been liked nearly 24,000 times. Both believe it was sometime in Season 2&mdash;quite possibly one of the episodes in which a curly-haired liberal senator hauls members of the Roy family in front of a Senate committee, about which Brown, a curly-haired liberal, recalls having a lot to say. TIME caught up with Brown this week for a Zoom interview about his take on the show and its policy implications. (Warning: this piece is chock-full of spoilers.)<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>The show centers on the business dealings of the <a href="https://time.com/6105941/succession-wealth-gap-tv/" >wealthy Roy family</a> and their fictional New York City-based company, Waystar Royco. Washington enters the picture at the end of Season 2, when Cousin Greg, played by Nicholas Braun, struggles to explain to lawmakers his actions covering up rampant misconduct on the company&rsquo;s cruise lines. But after that, the senators and committee are never seen again. Brown believes an actual Senate hearing would have produced more results. Greg &ldquo;would have been the one from that congressional hearing that they would not have let go,&rdquo; Brown says. &ldquo;Even pro-corporate Republican senators, who always let corporate interests dictate their actions&mdash;their legislative actions and other political actions&mdash;he would not have gotten away with that. So the part that I knew best, the congressional hearing, was not as true to life as perhaps it could have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Brown generally believes the show to be pretty realistic, particularly its depiction of rich people behaving badly and never seeming to face any consequences. &ldquo;No matter what they do, no matter what mistake that would affect the rest of us might happen, they never pay a price for it, and no rules apply to them,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And it&#8217;s pretty disheartening when you think about people like that, that have so much influence on our economy and on our government. What&#8217;s distressing about it is the power that people like that have where I work, and on Wall Street, and that the voters continue to allow those kinds of people to have that kind of power in their own lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the superficial resemblance, Brown, like most watchers, thinks Sen. Gil Eavis, played by Eric Bogosian, is more likely based on Sen<strong>. </strong>Bernie Sanders. &ldquo;I liked how he took on the Roy family,&rdquo; Brown says of Eavis, &ldquo;but he didn&rsquo;t seem as genuine doing it as my colleague Bernie is, frankly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brown and Schultz watch TV in their family room in Cleveland, where they have matching leather recliners (&ldquo;so dorky,&rdquo; she says), but during <a href="https://time.com/5662975/succession-theme-song/" ><em>Succession </em></a>she likes to sit on a couch to the side instead so she can see his face. Brown makes the popcorn, which he likes with butter and Schultz likes to top with yeast. Their two rescue dogs, Franklin and Walter, wander in and out of the room. Amid a challenging few years in the Senate, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always trying to come up with distractions for him,&rdquo; she says. But his mind is rarely far from his job. &ldquo;So often he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Stop for a second,&rsquo; because he has to tell me who it reminds him of, or &lsquo;I forgot to tell you this thing that happened this week in committee hearings.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The episodes that stand out to Brown are the ones where working people become victims of the Roys&rsquo; heartless greed: the Season 1 finale, in which drug-addicted wastrel son Kendall Roy abandons a waiter to drown; the Season 2 finale, in which a company report categorizes the deaths of lowly cruise-line workers as &ldquo;No Real Person Involved.&rdquo; &ldquo;The &lsquo;No Real Person Involved&rsquo; was almost anybody who was powerless, particularly people that didn&#8217;t look like them,&rdquo; Brown says. &ldquo;The people who serve them every day, the people that work at their Disney kind of park, the people who staff their cruises, are thrown, literally thrown into the ocean, and they didn&#8217;t think twice about it. These are just not real people to them because they&#8217;re not rich, because they&#8217;re not powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brown doesn&rsquo;t believe all rich people are bad&mdash;after all, he points out, some of them are Democrats&mdash;but he advocates policies that would make them pay more in taxes, have less political influence and treat their workers more humanely. &ldquo;We&#8217;ve seen the wealthiest people in this country get richer and richer and richer,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And we&#8217;ve seen stock prices go up, profits go up, executive compensation stratospheric, yet wages have remained flat. That&#8217;s the way the Roy family wants it. That&#8217;s the way the, I don&#8217;t mean to be partisan, but the 50 Republicans in the Senate want it. That&#8217;s the way that the people that have far too much influence in this country want it and the lobbyists that always hover around the Capitol want it. But it&#8217;s not what this country should have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schultz drew a similar parallel. &ldquo;About two episodes in, it suddenly occurred to me, &lsquo;You know, honey, these are the Republican donors,&rsquo;&rdquo; Schultz recalls. &ldquo;These are the people funding the people who are fighting you on everything in the Senate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the show is so miserable, why watch it? Brown admits to a certain morbid fascination, and also he admires the acting&mdash;he&rsquo;s partial to <a href="https://time.com/5696473/brian-cox-succession-finale-logan-roy/" >Brian Cox</a>, who plays the patriarch Logan Roy, while Schultz is a fan of J. Smith-Cameron, who plays the mercenary executive Gerri Kellman. Schultz has a different explanation of the show&rsquo;s appeal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not at all escapist,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But I remember what I used to say when my friends were surprised I liked <i>The Sopranos</i>: It&rsquo;s all the revenge I can&rsquo;t get in real life. I said, &lsquo;If nothing else, honey, we can feel really good about our family compared to this.&rsquo;&rdquo; There may not be any justice, but at least on television, the regular folks get to watch the rich suffer instead of the other way around.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Americans will be able to request free at-home tests through COVIDTests.gov]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6139590"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2" data-src="https://time.com/6139590/free-covid-tests-biden/" data-widget-id="SB_4" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>(Washington D.C.) &mdash; The federal website where Americans can request free COVID-19 tests will begin accepting orders on Wednesday as the White House looks to address nationwide shortages, but supplies will be limited to just four free tests per home.</p>
<p>Starting on Jan. 19, the website COVIDTests.gov will provide tests at no cost, including no shipping fee, the White House announced Friday.</p>
<p>As he faced criticism for low inventory and long lines for testing, President Joe Biden announced last month that the U.S. would purchase 500 million at-home tests to launch the program and on Thursday the president announced that he was doubling the order to 1 billion tests.<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>But Americans shouldn&#8217;t expect a rapid turn-around on the orders and they will have to plan ahead and request the tests well before they meet federal guidelines for when to use a test.</p>
<p>The White House said &ldquo;tests will typically ship within 7-12 days of ordering&#8221; through the U.S. Postal Service, which reports shipping times of 1-3 days for its first-class package service in the continental United States.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends at-home testing when experiencing COVID-19 systems including fever, cough, sore throat, respiratory symptoms and muscle aches, five days after a potential COVID-19 exposure, or as part of test-to-stay protocols in schools and workplaces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly if you&rsquo;re going to gather with family, if you&rsquo;re going to a gathering where people are immunocompromised or where they&rsquo;re elderly or where you have people who might be unvaccinated or poorly protected from a vaccine that might be an opportunity you want to test,&rdquo; said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, on Wednesday.</p>
<div class="video-container"><div id="WQnmS3Rs" class="jw-video" data-media-id="test"></div></div>
<p>Officials emphasized that the federal website is just one way for people to procure COVID-19 tests. Starting on Saturday, private insurance companies will be required to cover the cost of at-home rapid tests, allowing Americans to be reimbursed for tests they purchase at pharmacies and online retailers. That covers up to eight tests per month.</p>
<p>The White House said the four-test limit on website orders will be applied to each residential address and will apply to the first tranche of 500 million tests. It estimates that the cost of purchasing and distributing the first block of tests at $4 billion.</p>
<p>Officials said they are cognizant that any launch of a website carries some risks&mdash;and memories of the disastrous roll-out during the Obama administration of Healthcare.gov are still fresh&mdash;but said they believe they are well-positioned to handle expected demand for tests.</p>

<p>(PROVIDENCE, R.I.)&mdash; A Rhode Island man who is believed to have faked his death and fled the U.S. to evade prosecution in Utah and other states has been apprehended in Scotland after being hospitalized with COVID-19, authorities said.</p>
<p>Nicholas Alahverdian was discovered after developing a serious case of the coronavirus and being placed on a ventilator at a hospital in Glasgow, Rhode Island State Police Maj. Robert Creamer told The Providence Journal on Wednesday. Alahverdian, 34, who had been a vocal critic of Rhode Island&rsquo;s child welfare system in recent years, now faces extradition to the U.S. to face a charge of first-degree rape in Utah.<br />

</div>
<p>Court documents unsealed Thursday show Alahverdian met a 21-year-old woman on MySpace in 2008, when he was living in Orem, Utah, and going by the name Nicholas Rossi, <a href="https://www.wpri.com/target-12/ri-man-who-police-believe-faked-his-own-death-found-in-scotland/"  target="_blank">WPRI-TV reported</a>. The woman said that she ended the relationship, but that Alahverdian owed her money, promised to pay her back and instead sexually assaulted her in his apartment.</p>
<p>Utah County Attorney David Leavitt&rsquo;s office said Wednesday that DNA evidence collected at the time wasn&#8217;t tested until 2017 as part of a state effort to test backlogged rape kits. The Utah evidence was ultimately came back as a match to a sexual assault case in Ohio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investigators also learned that Nicholas Rossi had fled the country to avoid prosecution in Ohio and attempted to lead investigators and state legislators in other states to believe that he was deceased,&rdquo; Leavitt&rsquo;s office said in a statement. &ldquo;Mr. Rossi was discovered to be living under an assumed name in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhode Island State Police have also said he is wanted in that state for failing to register as a sex offender, while the FBI have said he is also wanted in his home state of Ohio on charges he took out credit cards in his foster father&rsquo;s name and amassed more than $200,000 in debts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear whether Alahverdian has a lawyer; an email seeking comment was sent to the &ldquo;Alahverdian Family Office,&rdquo; which had sent a notice in 2020 about his funeral and memorial service at a church in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Alahverdian had for years been an outspoken critic of Rhode Island&rsquo;s Department of Children, Youth and Families, testifying before state lawmakers about being sexually abused and tortured while in foster care. In 2020, he told local media outlets he had late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma and had weeks to live, The Journal reported.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://apnews.com/article/aec7a7d76cadbf56e69686899ea2659d"  target="_blank">obituary</a> published online claimed he died Feb. 29, 2020, but by last year, Rhode Island state police, Alahverdian&rsquo;s former lawyer and former foster family were <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rhode-island/articles/2021-01-27/authorities-question-whether-child-welfare-activist-died"  target="_blank">publicly questioning</a> whether he actually died.</p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6139078/gun-violence-victim-story/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the U.S. in 2021, tens of thousands of people were shot. They were shot in schools and supermarkets, in churches and offices, in the streets and in their homes. Many were killed, many more were injured; the vast majority of victims were within inner-city communities. And as staggering as the total is, it does not speak to the ripple effect and trauma that these incidents cause. Here is one of those victims&#8217; stories.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the night of March 12, Davante Griffin, 25, was in his room at his home in Henry County, Georgia playing video games, when he started to hear loud noises coming from the house&rsquo;s ground floor. A friend&mdash;Griffin&rsquo;s brother and a number of friends were also present in the home&mdash;ran upstairs, saying that people were trying to break in, seemingly intent on robbing the property.</span></i><br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the ensuing home invasion, Griffin was shot in the leg. His brother was held at gunpoint; one of his friends was shot five times. While it was not Griffin&rsquo;s first experience with gun violence, the incident made him seriously reflect on how the problem has impacted his life and his community.</span></i></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had been shot at before; I&#8217;ve had friends who were shot. When I was a kid, my stepfather was shot and killed by a police officer. It&#8217;s not real easy out here, and you&#8217;ve got to watch what you do. But this was the first time I had ever been hit. And it really [hit home]: In the blink of an eye, you could be gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mind was racing. I had heard that you could die from a gunshot wound to the leg; I was just trying to stay awake. There wasn&rsquo;t a lot of pain, but [in the ambulance] I still didn&rsquo;t want to close my eyes. I was just thinking about my son, who was one at the time. I just wanted to stay alive for him. This was the first time I thought that I might not be there for him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the hospital, the police treated me like I was a suspect. They kept asking me the same questions&mdash;&ldquo;do you know who broke in?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why did they break in?&rdquo;&mdash;over and over. It felt like an interrogation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kept telling them I didn&rsquo;t know why the guys broke into the house. I knew they didn&rsquo;t believe me but there was nothing I could do about that.</span></p>
<p>These are experiences that you go through being where I&#8217;m from&mdash;being from Atlanta, being from the hood, period. A lot of us young people think this is the norm. But it shouldn&#8217;t be like that. You shouldn&#8217;t have to go through things like that. That&#8217;s not normal.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(In the months since the shooting, no arrests have been made to Griffin&rsquo;s knowledge. The Henry County Police Department did not respond to TIME&#8217;s request for comment regarding the incident.)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was discharged from the hospital later that night&mdash;I walked out in my [hospital] gown. But I still have little sharp pains in my leg sometimes; when I make a slight wrong move or something like that, I feel it a little bit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went to the hospital that my friend was at to make sure he was okay too. He made a full recovery&mdash;though he still has a bullet lodged in his neck<strong>.</strong> After that, I went to see my son. I wanted to make sure I was around him; I couldn&rsquo;t imagine not being here for him. He&rsquo;s a very affectionate kid, he&rsquo;s always kissing me and he shows a lot of love. This type of incident makes you think about your family and your kids.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In the weeks and months afterward] I kept replaying the shooting in my head. I had nightmares about it going differently. My little brother was in the house&mdash;in my nightmares, he gets killed. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy, but I think the outcome that happened was the best way for it to go. No one was killed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, these kinds of situations just make you paranoid. I&rsquo;ve moved twice since this happened. I keep to myself; it just makes you more alert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of what got me through was my family. They were very supportive. My brothers were checking in on me and bringing me things that I needed. Seeing my son every day got me through it too. In the immediate aftermath, I wanted revenge but [as time passed] I was just thinking, &ldquo;what are you living for if you&rsquo;re going to retaliate?&rdquo; I had to really stop fixating on it and just move on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was a kid, growing up around all of this was hard. We&rsquo;re just so accustomed to having a gun wherever you go; it&rsquo;s been so bad for so long. And I feel like gun violence is going to continue to happen unless we change our mindset. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Black community, we don&rsquo;t have enough leadership. Unfortunately in our communities, [many of us] don&rsquo;t have our fathers in our lives. They&rsquo;re not there to teach us. I still feel like I&#8217;m a kid in a way, because you&#8217;re never done growing. But I don&rsquo;t want my son to have the experiences I had growing up. I don&rsquo;t want him to be in circumstances where he has to have a gun. If he has a problem with somebody, he should be able to tell me and we can figure it out. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing from our community. Kids turn to guns rather than adults in their lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I really sit back and think about all of this, it starts with the household. We need to be conscious of what our kids are seeing at home and what we&rsquo;re teaching them. It has to start with us. If we really want to fix this problem, it has to start at home.</span></p>

<p>Starbucks Corp. employees at three more restaurants in New York state will vote on unionization, a U.S. labor official ruled Friday, offering organizers a chance to expand a new labor foothold that&rsquo;s already inspiring copycat efforts around the country.</p>
<p>In her ruling, Nancy Wilson, an acting regional director of the National Labor Relations Board, rejected the company&rsquo;s arguments against holding store-by-store votes. She ordered that ballots be mailed to employees on January 31 and due back by February 22.</p>
<p>Employees at the three stores will vote on joining Workers United, the same Service Employees International Union affiliate that recently won elections at two other sites in the same Buffalo region. Those two restaurants represent the sole unionized locations at Starbucks&rsquo;s roughly 9,000 corporate-run U.S. locations.</p>

<p>Workers are also slated to vote on joining Workers United this month in Arizona, and others have petitioned for votes in cities including Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Knoxville, Tennessee, and the company&rsquo;s hometown of Seattle.

<p>Ahead of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, President Biden visited the grave of Dr. King in Atlanta and <a href="https://time.com/6138696/joe-biden-voting-rights-filibuster/" >gave the angriest speech of his presidency</a>, insisting that the Senate has a <a href="https://time.com/5954792/voting-rights-moral-issue/" >moral obligation to protect voting rights</a>. After months of delay, Senate Leader Chuck Schumer finally moved to at least force open debate on federal voting rights legislation this week. As the nation honors <a href="https://time.com/equality/" >Dr. King and the civil rights movement&rsquo;s legacy</a>, Democrats are hoping against the longest odds that they can unite to push back against an assault on democracy that the President calls &ldquo;Jim Crow 2.0.&rdquo;<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>But America&rsquo;s memory of Jim Crow has been distorted by a political culture that pays lip service to Dr. King while forgetting his vision of a democracy that works for all Americans. From the Montgomery bus boycott to the passage of the Voting Rights Act, Dr. King was a spokesperson for the Black-led freedom movement that was determined to end <a href="https://time.com/5775300/segregation-separation/" >Jim Crow segregation</a> in America. But Dr. King was also clear that Black Americans did not simply want to be integrated into a burning house. They organized with a broad and diverse coalition of Americans to challenge the basic contradictions that threatened the promise of democracy for all people. The Beloved Community that Dr. King preached and organized toward wasn&rsquo;t just an America where Black, white and brown could sit down in a restaurant together. It was the hope of a political system where the Black, white and brown masses could vote together for leaders who serve the common good.</p>

<p>Today, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/regulations/us-chamber-key-vote-letter-s-1-the-the-people-act"  target="_blank">opposes both voting rights laws</a> and <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/testimony-raising-the-minimum-wage"  target="_blank">living wages</a>. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-chamber-backs-manchin-sinema-with-campaign-contributions-2021-04-15/"  target="_blank">They back Senators Kyrsten Sinema, Joe Manchin and</a> their Republican colleagues in an effort to normalize the subversion of democracy and make voting rights the special interest of minority groups. But they don&rsquo;t separate their money, so we surely shouldn&rsquo;t separate and bifurcate our movement demands for a democracy that works for everyday people. Voting rights are about power to write policy that impacts our daily lives and power to control the purse strings of the U.S. budget and over $21 trillion in gross domestic product.</p>
<div class="video-container"><div id="AMc8iowS" class="jw-video" data-media-id="test"></div></div>
<p>Since the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2013 decision in <a href="https://time.com/5890983/ruth-bader-ginsburg-voting-rights/" ><em>Shelby County vs. Holder</em></a>, the 1965 Voting Rights Act has been stripped of its power to check state legislatures where a majority wants to pass election law changes that make it more difficult for people to vote. So-called &ldquo;election integrity&rdquo; measures have been proposed in states with long histories of voter suppression, using the contemporary tools of voter-roll purges or voter ID requirements to reduce the potential power of a multiethnic voting coalition. Since 2013, when I led the NC NAACP in challenging the first voter-suppression bill passed by a state after the <em>Shelby</em> decision, I&rsquo;ve called this reality James Crow, Esquire. The data analysis and legal maneuvers are more sophisticated than Jim Crow, but the goal is the same: minority rule to preserve an unequal society while giving lip service to democracy.</p>

<p>The voter-suppression measures that became law in 19 states last year were justified by <a href="https://time.com/6112488/trump-2020-election-republicans/" >Trump&rsquo;s Big Lie</a> about the 2020 election, but the &ldquo;election integrity&rdquo; measures they make law are not new. Rolling back voter access, purging voting rolls, requiring strict forms of voter ID and gerrymandering districts so that Republicans can win a majority without getting a majority of the votes are all tools in the James Crow, Esquire toolbox. Yes, they disproportionately harm Black voters and voters of color. But their impact hurts most of us.</p>
<p>When Dr. King spoke at the end of the <a href="https://time.com/3647070/selma-john-lewis-voting-rights-act/" >Selma to Montgomery March in 1965</a>, he noted that as long as the Southern aristocracy could pit poor white people against poor Black people with the idea of race, they could prevent people from joining together in a democratic society to reconstruct an economy that works for everyone. &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; Dr. King concluded, &ldquo;the threat of the free exercise of the ballot by the Negro and the white masses alike resulted in the establishment of a segregated society&hellip; That&rsquo;s what happened when the Negro and white masses of the South threatened to unite and build a great society.&rdquo; Jim Crow always had a purpose: preventing the multiethnic voting coalition that could create a more equal society.</p>
<p>The assault on voting rights that we have witnessed over the past decade is about more than <a href="https://time.com/5902729/black-voter-suppression-2020/" >suppressing Black votes</a>. James Crow, Esquire employs an array of tactics to prevent everyday people from having the power to elect leaders who would enact policies the vast majority of Americans support, like living wages, universal access to health care, <a href="https://time.com/6098412/melinda-french-gates-paid-leave/" >paid family leave</a>, immigration reform and meaningful action to address the <a href="https://time.com/6130470/climate-change-2021-build-back-better/" >climate crisis.</a></p>

<p>Whatever the fate of the current legislation in the Senate, we must build a broad, multiethnic coalition to fight together for democracy in America. This is why the Poor People&rsquo;s Campaign has announced plans for a <a href="https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/livestream/"  target="_blank">Mass Poor People&rsquo;s and Low Wage Workers Assembly and Moral March on Washington on June 18</a>. However much we are able to push back against the present assault on voting rights, we need people from every race, creed and culture to unite in support of the common good and mount an historic get-out-the-vote effort this fall. No one would put this much energy into suppressing our votes if a multiethnic coalition did not have the potential to change this nation. This MLK weekend, we must resolve to do what Dr. King noted our foreparents did during Reconstruction: unite and build a great society.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Colombia’s presidential front-runner Gustavo Petro is calling on ideological allies across the world to join him in forming a new anti-fossil fuel bloc.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-6139508"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/6139508/gustavo-petro-anti-oil-bloc/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>Colombia&rsquo;s presidential front-runner Gustavo Petro is calling on ideological allies across Latin America and the world to join him in forming a new bloc to lead the economy away from fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Oil and coal currently account for nearly half of Colombia&rsquo;s exports, but Petro says if he becomes president this year, he&rsquo;ll push to start phasing out these industries in favor of a knowledge-based, tourism-driven economy. If Colombia immediately halts oil exploration, but continues to produce the crude it&rsquo;s already drilling, it would have 12 years to manage the transition, he said in an interview from Bogota.</p>
<p>Senator Petro, 61, said his vision involves &ldquo;a grand coalition of powers that can speak much more strongly in a global context to fight against climate change, and to transition Latin America toward economies that are decarbonized, productive and based on knowledge.&rdquo;<br />
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>
<p>Such an alliance will hopefully include Chile&rsquo;s president-elect Gabriel Boric, and Brazil&rsquo;s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, he said Thursday. It may not include Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who he said favors extractive industries.</p>
<p>Petro said he recently spoke to Spain&rsquo;s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez about his proposal.</p>
<p>While such a global alliance would not be a new concept &#8212; world leaders have been meeting for years to try to cut fossil fuel dependence&mdash;it is unusual for a developing country that&rsquo;s highly dependent on energy exports to be so enthusiastic about sacrificing its biggest source of foreign currency.</p>
<p>The peso weakened the most in emerging markets on Friday, to as low as 4,015 per dollar, as traders reacted to Petro&rsquo;s comments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The market didn&rsquo;t like these remarks, given the importance of oil both for national output and the current account,&rdquo; Banco de Bogota said in a note.</p>
<p>The rise of green politics implies tough choices in a region whose economies depend on oil and mining. Petro argues that Colombia can phase out fossil fuel production without jeopardizing the fight against poverty and infant malnutrition.</p>
<p>Attracting tourists to experience the nation&rsquo;s natural beauty offers the best opportunity to replace lost oil revenues but, for this to happen, the country needs peace, he said.</p>
<h2>Peace Talks</h2>
<p>Five years after the Marxist guerrilla group known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, laid down its weapons, the countryside is still overrun with illegal armed groups. Petro said that swift negotiations with dissident FARC groups who turned their back on the peace process, and the guerrilla force known as the ELN, could dismantle these organizations.</p>
<p>Petro himself was a member of the guerrilla force known as M-19, but demobilized more than three decades ago.</p>
<p>If he wins, he would be the first leftist ever to govern Colombia, though he says that &ldquo;left-wing&rdquo; and &ldquo;right-wing&rdquo; are now obsolete 20th century terms. The new fault line is between the &ldquo;politics of life&rdquo;, which defends the environment, and the &ldquo;politics of death&rdquo;, which advocates economic models based on the extraction of fossil fuels, in his view.</p>
<p>As an example of a successful economy from which Colombia might learn, Petro cited South Korea, which became wealthy without many natural resources.</p>
<h2>Weaker Peso</h2>
<p>A poll published last month showed Petro leading with 25%, more than double the support of his closest rival, independent candidate Rodolfo Hernandez, who had 11%. Colombians vote in May, with a possible runoff in June. Congressional elections are scheduled for March.</p>
<p>Petro&rsquo;s environmentalist proposals would represent a radical departure for one of the world&rsquo;s biggest coal exporters, where deforestation of the Amazon by cattle ranchers is surging. But since he&rsquo;s unlikely to command a majority in congress, he may find it difficult to advance his economic agenda if he wins.</p>
<p>Colombia produces more than 700,000 barrels of crude a day, making it the biggest South American producer after Brazil and Venezuela. Much of it is delivered by state-owned Ecopetrol SA.</p>
<p>In part because of Petro&rsquo;s strong showing in the polls, Colombian assets are trading with significant risk premium and investors will remain wary until that changes, Barclays economists Alejandro Arreaza and Juan Prada wrote in a report published this week. The peso has weakened 13% over the last year, the worst performance in emerging markets after the Turkish lira and the Argentine peso.</p>
<p>Petro says he can&rsquo;t be held responsible for market moves that have happened when he isn&rsquo;t in office.</p>
<p>On fiscal policy, he takes a conservative, orthodox approach, but holds less conventional views in other areas.</p>
<p>As mayor of Bogota from 2012 to 2015 he cut debt, and now says Colombia needs to lower its fiscal deficit. To do this, he proposes taxing &ldquo;fertile, unused land&rdquo; and a &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; increase in the levy on dividends.</p>
<h2>Interest Rates</h2>
<p>The candidate also urged Colombia&rsquo;s central bank not to raise interest rates any more, even if the U.S. Federal Reserve starts to tighten policy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If interest rates rise in Colombia, the economic recovery is killed off,&rdquo; Petro said. &ldquo;If they go up, the capacity for productive investment in the country decreases because it shifts toward other types of investment of a more speculative and financial type, than of a productive kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colombia&rsquo;s central bank has raised interest rates by 1.25 percentage point since September, to 3%, in a bid to rein in inflation which has surged above its target range. Economists expect more increases this year.</p>
<p>After he left the guerrillas for democratic politics, Petro gained prominence in the senate as a critic of Alvaro Uribe, who was president from 2002-2010. As mayor, Petro boosted subsidies on water and bus fares for the poor.</p>
<p>In the last elections four years ago, he made it to the second round, but lost to the current President Ivan Duque. Since then, he has been back in the senate.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Andes, Peruvians last year elected Pedro Castillo from the socialist Peru Libre party to the presidency, while Boric, a former student leader who describes himself as a moderate socialist, was voted president of Chile.</p>
<p>Petro, if he wins, would be part of that change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My government will be one of transitions,&rdquo; Petro said. &ldquo;From extraction to production, from authoritarianism to democracy, from violence to peace.&rdquo;</p>
